        "# SpaceX API Data Ingestion and SQL Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "This exercise is designed to assess your Python and SQL skills while working with real-world data. You will interact with the SpaceX API, store the data in a structured format, and perform analysis using Python and SQL.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "SpaceX provides a public API that exposes detailed information about their launches, rockets, crew members, and more. In this exercise, we will work with the following API endpoints:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Launches:** `/v4/launches` - Provides detailed information about SpaceX launches, including launch dates, rocket IDs, and crew IDs.\n",
        "- **Rockets:** `/v4/rockets` - Provides information about SpaceX rockets, such as their names and IDs.\n",
        "- **Crew:** `/v4/crew` - Provides information about astronauts who have been part of SpaceX missions, including their names, agencies, and associated launches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your objective is to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Explore the SpaceX API and understand the data returned by these endpoints.\n",
        "2. Set up a Python class to manage and process the data.\n",
        "3. Store the data in an SQLite database.\n",
        "4. Write Python functions to interact with the database and answer key questions."

        "### Task\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Visit the [SpaceX API documentation](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API) and familiarise yourself with the structure of the data returned by the `/v4/launches`, `/v4/rockets`, and `/v4/crew` endpoints.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Write Python code to:\n",
        "   - Fetch data from these three endpoints using the `requests` library.\n",
        "   - Print a sample of the data (e.g., the first 2-3 records) to understand its structure and the fields available.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Take note of key fields, such as `id`, `rocket`, `date_utc` in the `launches` endpoint and `name`, `agency` in the `crew` endpoint, which you will need for further processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example Output\n",
        "For `/v4/launches`, you should identify fields like:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `id`: The unique identifier for a launch.\n",
        "- `rocket`: The ID of the rocket used in the launch.\n",
        "- `date_utc`: The UTC date and time of the launch.\n",
